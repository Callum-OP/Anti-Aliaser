I wanted a program that would apply anti-aliasing to an existing line drawing that didn't have anti-aliasing, so I created this simple Python program.

By placing and naming a file "LineDrawing.png" and running the program, it will be modified to have an anti-aliasing effect and the modified version will placed in "output.png".

This program does not work for coloured images.


Below is a before and after image
