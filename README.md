# How to run
Visit the website, enter a png line art image and it will run, then download the image or copy to clipboard to save it.

# About the program
I wanted a program that would apply anti-aliasing to an existing digital line drawing that didn't have anti-aliasing, so I created this simple web app.

By placing a file in the site, it will be modified to have an anti-aliasing effect with the option to download or copy to clipboard.

This program does not work for coloured images and is only designed for line art.

This program works by blurring the image, thinning the lines in the image and fading the edges to create an anti-aliasing effect. The result is the final image will likely look more smooth and slightly thinner as if it was drawn with a brush with anti-aliasing, the image should also remain transparent and ready to be used.


Below is a before and after image.
